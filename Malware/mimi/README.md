## Approach
1. I stumbled upon the word mimi..., and naturally, my brain screamed Mimikatz! But, when I tried using both `mimikatz.exe` and `pypykatz`, I hit a brick wall. They just weren’t working for me!
2. So, I turned to Google for help, and that's when I came across this super helpful [writeup](https://metactf.com/blog/flash-ctf-mimicant/). It suggested an alternative approach using WinDBG and a DLL to analyze an lsass.DMP dump.
3. The basic steps are as follows:
   ```
   Open lsass.DMP with WinDBG
   .load <path-to-mimilib.dll>
   !mimikatz
   Get credentials
   ```

4. I followed the steps outlined in the guide, fired up WinDBG, and loaded the mimilib.dll. When I typed !mimikatz, ... BOOM! I found the credentials, and the flag was right there waiting for me.
