## Approach

1. The first step was a basic OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). A quick search revealed the company's website.

2. Under the [team](https://pyrchdata.com/team) section, we can find other employees:

3. Since this is a phsihing exercise and we were given a port number, indicating an exposed SMTP server. With this in mind, we decided to craft our email using Joe Daveren's format. We chose to impersonate him because, as the IT Security Manager, his identity would lend credibility to our phishing attempt. We then set him as the sender (jdaveren@pyrchdata.com) and targeted the email directly to Sarah Williams (swilliams@pyrchdata.com).

   ```bash
   MAIL FROM:<jdaveren@pyrchdata.com>
   RCPT TO:<swilliams@pyrchdata.com>
   DATA
   Subject: Urgent: Action Required to Keep Your Account Active

   Dear Sarah,

   Best regards,
   Joe Daveren
