# Huntress-CTF-2024

After a wild month in the Huntress CTF 2024, my amazing teammates and I are proud to announce we ranked 222 out of 3,448 teams! 🏅

From breezing through warmup challenges to cracking complex malware, digging into forensics, decoding reverse engineering puzzles, and hacking our way through web exploits, we faced it all. This CTF pushed us to explore new tools, level up our skills, and collaborate like never before. It was a thrilling ride filled with late-night problem-solving, teamwork, and lots of “aha!” moments — and we loved every bit of it!
