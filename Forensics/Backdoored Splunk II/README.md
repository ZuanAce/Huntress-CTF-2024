## Approach
1. It's my first time doing this challenge, so I did some Google search. I noticed that this challenge is very similar with the [Backdoored Splunk](https://github.com/LazyTitan33/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/Huntress-CTF-2023/Forensics/Backdoored_Splunk.md) challenge from last year.
   However, after some digging, I found something suspicious in the `dns-health.ps1 file`:

3. ChatGPT suggested that "1200" relates to modulated data signals, which led me to use a tool called **Minimodem**,  a command-line program which decodes (or generates) audio modem tones at any specified baud rate, using various framing protocols. It acts a general-purpose software FSK modem, and includes support for various standard FSK protocols such as Bell103, Bell202, RTTY, TTY/TDD, NOAA SAME, and Caller-ID. After installing it, I ran:
   
   ```
   minimodem --rx 1200 -f transmissions.wav
   ``` 

4. Success! I decoded a hidden message along with the flag!
