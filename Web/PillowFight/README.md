## Approach
1. At first glance, it looked like a regular music file: song.mp3. Nothing unusual, right? But something about it seemed… strange. My instinct told me to dig a little deeper, so instead of hitting play, I checked the file type directly.
   Sure enough, this "mp3" wasn’t a music file at all—it was actually an image file in disguise!

2. With a quick file rename from *.mp3* to *.png*, I opened the file to reveal...the FLAG!
