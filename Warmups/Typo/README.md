## Approach
1. The title hint "Typo" was a subtle nudge. Here’s how I cracked it ~ First, I used *ssh -p 31779 user@challenge.ctf.games "ls -la"* to list all files and check for the flag's location.
   Guess what I found the flag.txt!

3. Then, I revealed the contents of flag.txt with *ssh -p 31779 user@challenge.ctf.games "cat flag.txt"*
