## Approach
1. I started with 50 virtual dollars and a shopping list. My goal? Buy “The Flag.” I tested the waters by buying a couple of apples, which subtracted 6 dollars from my balance, confirming the program’s math.

2. A lightbulb moment: what if I entered a negative quantity? Negative numbers should add money to my wallet, right? I gave it a shot, and it worked! With each “negative” purchase, my wallet grew fatter.

4. With an overstuffed balance, I bought “The Flag,” and a quick check in my inventory confirmed my prize.
