## Approach
1. The challenge hinted at an odd DNS record for the ctf.games domain, so I decided to investigate.
   Using the [DNS Checker Tool](https://dnschecker.org/all-dns-records-of-domain.php?query=ctf.games&rtype=ALL&dns=google), I pulled up all the DNS records for ctf.games and, sure enough, spotted a strange TXT record. This looked like it could contain something important.

3. The TXT record itself appeared to be a string of ASCII codes.
   To make sense of it, I turned to an [ASCII converter tool](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code) to translate it. After converting the codes, the output revealed exactly what I was hoping forâ€”a flag!
