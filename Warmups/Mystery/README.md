## Approach
1. I plugged the ciphertext into the [Enigma Decoder](https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine) and quickly unraveled the hidden message.

3.Looked closely and the decoded message actually read as below:
  ```
  message wrapped in light hidden deeper out of sight locking it more tight anyway your flag is here flag fdfea bcacb ebfba daefb eccaa dddba fezzz
  ```

4. The flag was right there! But it wasn’t clear if it should have spaces, underscores, or just be continuous. After some trial and error, I figured out the format. The flag is supposed to be 32 characters (inside the curly braces). The last zzz will get cut off.
   
## Flag: 
flag{fdfeabcacbebfbadaefbeccaadddbafe}
